This repository is intended to act as a personal website.

Code will be developed for it using various frameworks/libs such as
* Angular (8+)
* React
* Maybe Vue
* and possibly others

I'll eventually get around to creating a master switch between viewing the content the same way between all of the different implementations but github *user* pages specifically has made this a little more difficult than I originally thought.

A few quick points to address faqs:
* The ugly url is done to actually serve from a nested directory since github *user/organization* pages does not support serving from a nested directory or from a branch other than master.

* Refreshing works because they *thankfully* allow a 404 fallback which is served as the response to a 404 request and not acting as a redirect which allows an SPA to survive.

* Why did you build this in Angular? I'm planning on using other development libs/frameworks as well, I just haven't gotten around to those.

* If you see code that deeply upsets you or feel could be better, feel free to let me know if you think it's something that should be corrected. It should go without saying that this should be done in a polite and respectful manner.

* If I don't respond to you in whatever you consider to be a timely manner, it's not necessarily that I'm ignoring you, I just have other things I do.
